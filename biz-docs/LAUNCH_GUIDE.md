A       @       76.76.21.21
CNAME   www     cname.vercel-dns.com
```

(Vercel will show you the exact records after deployment)

## Your Pitch (Reference)

### One-liner
*We make AI actually effective on legacy codebases‚Äîby turning your code into agent-ready context and upskilling your engineers.*

### 30-second pitch
*Most enterprises tried "paste the repo into an LLM" and got generic answers. The missing ingredient is context engineering at the code level. We deploy Intent, our layered guidance system (agents.md + verification), measure Agent Effectiveness on real tasks, and train your teams to maintain it. In 4‚Äì6 weeks we take a legacy service from "LLMs hallucinate" to "agents ship safe changes your leads would approve."*

### Your Offers

1. **Agent Effectiveness Assessment** (2 weeks) ‚Üí $35k‚Äì$60k
   - Baseline how "agent-ready" the code is
   - AES score + top 10 targets + rollout plan

2. **Pilot Modernization Sprint** (4‚Äì6 weeks) ‚Üí $120k‚Äì$250k
   - Layered agents.md + Intent tool installed
   - AES +40‚Äì70 pts, lead-time ‚Äì30%

3. **Scale-out & Enablement** (quarterly) ‚Üí $300k‚Äì$750k/quarter
   - Roll to 6‚Äì12 services
   - Org-wide coverage >80%
   - Quarterly value reports
