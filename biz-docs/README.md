# Business Documentation

Internal business docs for Intent Systems. Everything lives in Cursor for rapid iteration.

## What's Here

```
biz-docs/
├── LAUNCH_GUIDE.md        # Go-to-market strategy, launch plan
├── pitch-deck.md          # Sales deck (when created)
├── contracts/             # Templates (MSA, SOW, NDA)
├── case-studies/          # Client results (anonymized)
└── outreach/              # Email templates, LinkedIn posts
```

## Purpose

Keep all business context colocated with code:
- **Positioning** (one-liner, ICP, offers)
- **Sales materials** (decks, one-pagers, contracts)
- **Client work** (case studies, success metrics)
- **Outreach** (cold emails, LinkedIn content)

**Why here?** Because you live in Cursor anyway. No context switching to Notion/Docs.

## Quick Reference

- **ICP**: CTOs at 200–5,000 engineer companies with legacy modernization pressure
- **Entry offer**: Agent Effectiveness Assessment (2 weeks, $35k–$60k)
- **Positioning**: "Make AI effective on your legacy code"
- **Website**: https://intent-systems.com
- **Email**: hello@intent-systems.com

## Add New Docs

Just create Markdown files here. Keep them structured:
- `contracts/msa-template.md`
- `case-studies/pilot-01-anonymized.md`
- `outreach/cold-email-cto.md`

No special tooling needed. Plain text, version controlled, always accessible.
